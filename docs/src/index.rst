SDP Workflow Library
====================

The SDP workflow library is a high-level interface for writing workflows. Its
goal is to provide abstractions to enable the developer to express the
high-level organisation of a workflow without needing to interact directly with
the low-level interfaces such as the SDP configuration library.
